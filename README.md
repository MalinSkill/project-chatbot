# Chatbot

A chatbot to practice my first introduction to javaScript. 
The caht should repeat the user input and follow up with correct question.
Using if else statement, to show different answer depending on the reply from user. I choose to go for a theme were you you get a recipe to try out. With limited answers the user can choose from.

## The problem

Passing the values from the different eventlisteners and having the answer and reply show up at correct time.
I struggled a lot with the eventlisteners, but after a lot of googling and checking earlier students project I got a better understanding. I also learned that if I want to access a vaule from an input later on. It needs to be stored in a global variable and not inside the functions, thanks to my team-mate who made this easier to understand. If I had more time I would try and arrange the code in a better way.
